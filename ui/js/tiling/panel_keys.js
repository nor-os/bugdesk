/**
 * panel_keys.js — central keyboard router for panel-local navigation.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
 * ---------------------
 * Several panels want plain-key navigation (↑/↓ to move a cursor, Enter to
 * open, single letters for actions): the landing tables, the markets /
 * agents / analytics overviews, and any future browser panel. Each one used
 * to attach its OWN `document` keydown listener gated by the heuristic
 *
 *     hostEl.contains(document.activeElement) || activeElement === <body>
 *
 * That heuristic is wrong as soon as there is more than one tile. When the
 * user selects a different tile, focus usually rests on `<body>`, so EVERY
 * mounted landing's listener still fires — the "main" panel keeps eating
 * arrow keys even though another panel is selected, and two panels can move
 * their cursors at once. The selected tile is never actually consulted.
 *
 * THE CONCEPT
 * -----------
 * One listener, one authority. Panels do not listen on `document`
 * themselves; they REGISTER a handler bound to their host element. On each
 * keydown the router asks the window manager which leaf is currently
 * focused (the single source of truth — `WindowManager.focusedLeafEl()`)
 * and dispatches the event to the handler whose host lives inside that leaf
 * — and to no one else. A panel automatically receives keys exactly when,
 * and only when, it is the selected tile.
 *
 * Content rendered OUTSIDE the tile tree (a promoted managed window or a
 * floating shell) has no focused-leaf concept; for those hosts the router
 * falls back to the focus-containment scope so they keep working.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *     import { registerPanelKeys } from './panel_keys.js';
 *     const off = registerPanelKeys(hostEl, (ev) => { ... });
 *     // later, on teardown:
 *     off();
 *
 * The handler is responsible for its own key semantics (which keys, whether
 * to skip editable targets, when to preventDefault). The router only decides
 * WHETHER this panel is the active keyboard target. A handler that calls
 * `ev.preventDefault()` stops the event from reaching any other handler in
 * the same leaf.
 *
 * When no router has been installed (unit tests, or a landing used outside
 * the WM), `registerPanelKeys` degrades to a self-contained listener using
 * the legacy focus-containment scope, so callers work in isolation too.
